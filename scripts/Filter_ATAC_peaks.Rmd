### version 4

this requires `furrr` https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr

#install.packages("tictoc")
# for measuring time elapse
#library(tictoc)

## this is the function to define how many clusters in total should have more than pct.each.out.cutoff
## default n = 2 which means for a peak to remain, no more than 2 clusters should have more than 10% of cells that have that peak/signal
## num_cluster_off_cells tell you how many CLUSTERS have greater than or equal to the max.num.off.target.cells.per.cluster...it does not tell you have many CELLS are contain the peak in question
